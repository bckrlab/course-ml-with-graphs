# Machine Learning with Graphs

## Course Materials

Slides, exercise solutions and optional readings are uploaded to ILIAS weekly.

You can download/run the exercise notebooks in the following pages.


## Python Environment

If you prefer working running notebooks locally, you can use the following steps to get a `Python` environment:

1. Download the `env.yml` file [here](assets/env.yml).

2. Create a `conda` environment. You can refer to [this](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) link for installation instructions for `conda`.
    ```
    conda create -f env.yml -n mlwg
    ```

3. After the packages are installed, activate the environment by:
    ```
    conda activate mlwg
    ```
